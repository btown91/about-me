# Andrew Brownbear — Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a cybersecurity student in the SANS program, holding GIAC certs (GFACT, GSEC, GISF) and building a path toward a professional role in Japan by 2027.

Here you'll find:

- 🔧 Linux hands-on labs and Bash scripting projects
- 🌐 Nmap walkthroughs and scan outputs
- 🔍 Wireshark traffic analysis examples
- 🧪 Home lab setup and architecture
- 🗂️ Scripts, notes, and troubleshooting logs

My goal is to demonstrate real, consistent progress across defensive and offensive security skills.
